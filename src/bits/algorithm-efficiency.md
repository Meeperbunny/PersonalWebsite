# Quick Tips for Algorithm Efficiency

When optimizing algorithms, small changes can lead to significant performance improvements. Here are a few quick tips to keep in mind:

1. **Choose the right data structure**: Using the appropriate data structure for your specific problem can drastically reduce time complexity. Hash tables offer O(1) lookups, while balanced trees provide O(log n) operations.

2. **Early termination**: When possible, exit loops and recursions as soon as you find what you're looking for, rather than processing the entire dataset.

3. **Avoid unnecessary computations**: Calculate values once and store them instead of recalculating multiple times.

4. **Space-time tradeoffs**: Sometimes using more memory (caching or memoization) can significantly speed up your algorithm.

5. **Consider the average case**: While worst-case analysis is important, optimizing for the most common input patterns can yield better real-world performance.

Remember, premature optimization can make code harder to read and maintain. Always profile your code to identify actual bottlenecks before optimizing!
