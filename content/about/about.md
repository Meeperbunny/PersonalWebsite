# About

Welcome to my corner of the internet! Here, you can find [stories of my adventures](/side-quests) and [reflections on the world](/thoughts).

### Currently

I enjoy tackling problems on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/meeperbunny), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/iamc7054/), and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/profile/Meeperbunny.png).

When I'm not pressing buttons, you can find me climbing rocks, taking walks, or immersing myself in a good book.

### Goals For 2025

* CodeForces GM (2400+)
* Read 50+ Books
* Be more present

Let's learn, grow, and explore together!
