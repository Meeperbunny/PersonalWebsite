It was a fine morning, as I had just solved [Project Euler Problem 479: Roots on the Rise](https://projecteuler.net/problem=479):

> <p>Let $a_k$, $b_k$, and $c_k$ represent the three solutions to the equation $\frac 1 x = (\frac k x)^2(k+x^2)-k x$.</p>
> <p>Let $\displaystyle S(n) = \sum_{p=1}^n\sum_{k=1}^n(a_k+b_k)^p(b_k+c_k)^p(c_k+a_k)^p$. Find $S(10^6)$ modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.</p>

As I perused the forums to see other's solutions, I was led to the Wikipedia page of 
[Vieta's formulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieta%27s_formulas). I am normally calm and collected when I find myself 
swarmed with more numbers and letters than I 
can count on my fingers, but something about the confident gaze of François Viète caught my eye: 
more specifically, that he was born in **1540**. He could have been my 15x great-grandfather!

After contemplation, I am grateful that we are able to learn not only math and science, but timeless lessons about life
and purpose from the billions of people who have come before.
